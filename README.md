Hello I am Aidan Ayers, a freshman applicant to the university of Maryland interested in Computer Science.
In order to challenge myself I took on this project with the aims to showcase what I know about math and object oriented programming.

The Solar System project will create objects representing planets, moons, and various points of orbit.
Using polar coordinates and vector addition and multiplication I will be able to find the distance between 2 bodies.
Thanks to the power of computers, I will be able to quickly iterate through a simulation time and find the distance of those bodies over time.
These values will be exported to an excel graph so that the distance can be graphed and visually represented.

Goals:
1. Track distance of Earth to the sun, it should remain constant
2. Track distance of Moon to the Earth, it should remain constant
3. Track distance of Moon to the sun, it should create a wave pattern
4. Draw a graph of Earths movement
5. Fully model every planet and moon in our solar system in a save file
6. Fully model every planet and moon from the game Outer Wilds in a seperate save file
7. Track specific points on the surface of a celestial body and their movements
8. Calculate if/when certain celestial bodies are visible

   I wanted this program to focus on reality, but I wanted to pay some homage to the game Outer Wilds.
   The game renewed my childhood interest in watching planets move, and I think it serves a purpose for my program
   It shows that my simulation can track movements in much smaller scales than the actual solar system
   It also shows that my simulation can handle tracking co-orbital planets because of the Hourglass Twins from the game
   Lastly, it shows that my program can be used to simulate foreign, hypothetical, or fictional solar systems as well as our own

Hello I am Aidan Ayers, a freshman applicant to the university of Maryland interested in Computer Science.
In order to challenge myself I took on this project with the aims to showcase what I know about math and object oriented programming.

The Solar System project will create objects representing planets, moons, and various points of orbit.
Using polar coordinates and vector addition and multiplication I will be able to find the distance between 2 bodies.
Thanks to the power of computers, I will be able to quickly iterate through a simulation time and find the distance of those bodies over time.
These values will be exported to an excel graph so that the distance can be graphed and visually represented.
